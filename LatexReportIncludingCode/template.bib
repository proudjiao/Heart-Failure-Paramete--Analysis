	abstract = {Let L be a lattice in Rn and φ the L-periodic Gaussian function on Rn given by φ(x)=∑y∈Le−‖x−y‖2. The paper was motivated by the following observation: φ(x+y)φ(x−y) is a positive definite function of two variables x,y. We say that a positive definite function φ on an Abelian group G is cross positive definite (c.p.d.) if, for each z∈G, the function φ(x+y+z)φ(x−y) of two variables x,y is positive definite. We say that a finite Radon measure on a locally compact Abelian group is c.p.d. if its Fourier transform is a c.p.d. function on the dual group. We investigate properties of c.p.d. functions and measures and give some integral characterizations. It is proved that the classes of c.p.d. functions and measures are closed with respect to certain natural operations. In particular, products, convolutions and Fourier transforms of c.p.d. functions and measures are c.p.d., whenever defined.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the density function of a Chi-squared variable on the basis of observations of another Chi-squared variable and a normal variable under the Kullback–Leibler divergence. We assume that these variables have a common unknown scale parameter and that the mean of the normal variable is also unknown. We compare the risk functions of two Bayesian predictive densities: one with respect to a hierarchical shrinkage prior and the other based on a noninformative prior. The hierarchical Bayesian predictive density depends on the normal variable while the Bayesian predictive density based on the noninformative prior does not. Sufficient conditions for the former to dominate the latter are obtained. These predictive densities are compared by simulation.}

	abstract = {Classification is one of the important tasks in data mining and machine learning. Classification performance depends on many factors as well as data characteristics. Some algorithms are known to work better with discrete data. In contrast, most real-world data contain continuous variables. For algorithms working with discrete data, these continuous variables must be converted to discrete ones. In this process called discretization, continuous variables are converted to their corresponding discrete variables. In this paper, four Chi-square based supervised discretization algorithms ChiMerge(ChiM), Chi2, Extended Chi2(ExtChi2) and Modified Chi2(ModChi2) were used. In the literature, the performance of these algorithms is often tested with decision trees and Naïve Bayes classifiers. In this study, differently, four sets of data discretized by these algorithms were classified with ensemble methods. Classification accuracies for these data sets were obtained through using a stratified 10-fold cross-validation method. The classification performance of the original and discrete data sets of the methods is presented comparatively. According to the results, the performance of the discrete data is more successful than the original data.}

	abstract = {Free-Comment (FC) and Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) provide a contingency table containing citation counts of descriptors by products. The analyses performed on this table are most often related to the chi-square statistic. However, such practices are not well suited because they consider experimental units as being the citations (one descriptor for one product by one subject) while the evaluations (vector of citations for one product by one subject) should be considered instead. This results in incorrect expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of independence between products and descriptors and thus in an incorrect chi-square statistic. Thus, analyses related to this incorrect chi-square statistic, which include Correspondence Analysis, can lead to wrong interpretations. This paper presents a modified chi-square square framework dedicated to the analysis of multiple-response data in which experimental units are the evaluations and which is, therefore, better suited to FC and CATA data. This new framework includes a multiple-response dimensionality test of dependence, a multiple-response Correspondence Analysis, and a multiple-response hypergeometric test to investigate which descriptors are significantly associated with which product. The benefits of the multiple-response chi-square framework over the usual chi-square framework are exhibited on real CATA data. An R package called “MultiResponseR” is available upon request to the authors and on GitHub to perform the multiple-response chi-square analyses.}
